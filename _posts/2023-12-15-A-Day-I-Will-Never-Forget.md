Denmark has long ranked high on the list of societies that American
liberals dream about turning the United States into. And for many good

That free education? Yes, it’s great, but it’s also fiercely guarded by meritocratic access. Every in-demand field of study is guarded by the all-important grade-point average from High School. If yours is too low, well, sorry, you’re just not going to study psychology or become a midwife. It doesn’t matter whether you came from an underprivileged background, did a million extracurriculars, or hail from an ethnic minority. You either make the grade for your first choice or you pick something else to study.
